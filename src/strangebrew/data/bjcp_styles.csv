Flavor: The spices/herbs should be expressed in the flavor but the honey character is still the backbone of the mead and should appear in the flavor but will vary in intensity depending on the spices/herbs used.  The spices/herbs should be expressed in the flavor as a distinctive enhancement to the honey flavor, whether harmoniously or by contrast, and should achieve a pleasant balance when a blend of spices/herbs is used.  Metheglins containing more than one spice should have a good balance among the different spices/herbs, though some spices/herbs will tend to dominate the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: Smooth texture.  Most will be wine-like, with the warming presence of alcohol and sense of medium body.  Sensations of a cloying or astringent character should be avoided; however,  some spices or herbs may affect mouthfeel particularly by adding astringency.Comments: Often, a blend of spices may give a character greater than the sum of its parts.  The better examples of this style use spices/herbs subtly and when more than one are used, they are carefully selected so that they blend harmoniously.  Entrants must specify whether the entry is still or sparkling mead.  Entrants must also specify whether the mead is dry, semi-sweet or sweet."

Aroma: Aroma of both honey and malt should be apparent and in balance. Hop aroma may be present but is not required.Appearance: Straw to dark brown depending on the type of malt and honey used.  Some head retention is expected.  Clear, although some chill haze may be present at low temperatures.Flavor: There should be some balance between the beer aspect and the mead aspect of a braggot, especially with regard to maltiness and bitterness versus honey character.  Malt character ranges from light pale malt-type flavors to rich caramel flavors, depending on the malt used.  Hop bitterness and flavor may be present but are not required.Mouthfeel: Body may vary from light to medium.  Smooth mouthfeel without astringency.  Carbonation may vary from light to very lively.Comments: The fermentable sugars should come from a balance of malt and honey, otherwise the beverage might better be entered as a Specialty Beer with the addition of honey.  As a rule of thumb, the fermentables should consist of no less than 1/3 malt and no more than 2/3 honey.  Hopped examples of this style should exhibit the hops distinctly and should have at least 15 IBUs.  "
