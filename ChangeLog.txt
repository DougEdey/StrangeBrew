Feb 21, 2008 - Drew Avis
- Added check for MacOS/X to splash, which makes the app look more native on Macs.  (Suggested by
Greg LaPolla).

Jan 26, 2008 - Jim Clark
- Carried re-cacle bug fix into WaterPanel. DilutionPanel may still need work, but it uses JSpinners and needs more investigation first.
- Moved StrangeSwing.round() into SBStringUtils since its sort of the inverse functionality of SBStringUtils.format().
   Ei: you format a double to a string for display and you round a display string to a double.

Jan 22, 2008 - Drew Avis
- Worked on re-calc bug, and fixed a bug where recipes saved using vol units != US gals were importing size
incorrectly (the problem is in Recipe.setVolUnits(), which was converting rather than just setting units). I
think we still need a Recipe.convertVolUnits(), which is called when you change units...

Jan 17-18, 2008 - Jim Clark
- Modified how Recipe stores wort volumes to cut down on the number of variables neededing to be in sync. This
   should provide a cleaner/easier interface to Recipe for DilutedRecipe.
- Reworked StrangeSwing to consolidate all of the event listners and the "displayRecipe()" call to prevent infinite
   recurtion loops as one display calls display recipe which sets a data element with a listner that calls displayRecipe.
   As a side effect, this elimintate a significant amount of extranious event calls coming out of that function. What used
   to happen would end up recurcivly calling event setters all over thoughout the app, now it only calls the ones on the page
   in view. The reset calls are all triggered off using the tab pane now.
- Finished off DilutedRecipe. Works seamlessly thoughout app and all the ugglyness is contained in DilutedRecipe and DilutedPanel.

Jan 16, 2008 - Jim Clark
- Changed many "ArrayList"s to "List"'s to follow best pratices when using collections. Ei: Program in terms of an 
   interface type (List) rather than implementation type (ArrayList). Eg:
 		List list = new ArrayList();
   is better than:
        ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
   This is so later when we want that Array to be a LinkedList or some custom list implementation of our own, everthgin just
   works.
- Started ripping Diluted Recipe stuff out of Recipe. Currently I would say Diluted Recipe is broken beyond imagineing, but I wanted
   to check this in now, since most of the changes left are going to be in DilutedRecipe.java and DilutionPanel.java and shouldn't
   make it a merging nightmare in a week when I am finaly done.

Jan 16, 2008 - Drew Avis
- Added support for saved column widths between application sessions.

Jan 15, 2008 - Drew Avis
- Now we handle the situation where the ingredient DB is moved.
- Adding Ant build file.

Jan 14, 2008 - Jim Clark
- Fixed some bugs with Salts and moved data out of CVS into static array. The data contents are tightly coupled to the salt calculations
   so it didn't make sense to have the salts configurable on the fly when adding a salt still involved some code work to impliement
   this helped clean up the WaterTreatmentPanel too, so overall.. IMHO, better.
- Added gram->tsp conversion into salt addisions.
- Added acid required for 5.2pH target as well as to hit target water pH. Some people like to emulate water, some like 5.2.

Jan 9, 2008 - Jim Clark
- Added conversion dialog to menu (wopse - missed 2.0.1)

Jan 7, 2008 - Jim Clark
- Fixed bug with the "isDirty" flag and the Carb Panel so that all recipes arn't always dirty or in need of being saved all the time
- Fixed Salt toString functions.

Jan 7, 2008 - Drew Avis
- Fixed broken format string in WaterProfile.toString().
- Fixed a bug on the Note tab where notes were being lost.
- Made debug output optional (w/ -d command line option)

Jan 5, 2008 - Jim Clark
- Down to 1 Type safty warrnings by implemeing various Collection<Type> stuff in various places.
   The one remaining is due to calling Generics unfrinedly SWING code.
- Moved prime sugar and keg presure calcs into Recipe from UI
- Moved water treatment/acid/salt calcs into recipe
- Added acid to save/load/xlst printing
- Acid pulls values from source and target water (perhaps a bad thing?)
- Changed some class comparisons to use instanceof keyword instead of string compareing the class name

Jan 3-4, 2008 - Drew Avis
- Added some tooltips for toolbar buttons
- Added copy to clipboard toolbar button
- Fixed bug where a new hop had Add and Type switched
- You can now set target vol on the carbonation tab
- Tried to get priming sugar amount to re-calculate when you set targetVol on the recipe, but gave up
- Cleaned up some Java 1.6 things (String.isEmpty)
- Made a few changes to reduce compiler warnings (use of raw ArrayList)

Dec 28, 2007 - Jim Clark
- Consolidated a lot of fixed strings scatetred though out app into static strings to
   help prevent fat fingers and what not and to create more readable code. Still more to
   do, especialy in Quantity(), but I got most of them.
- Fixed bug with Salt check boxes not adding/removeing salt from recipe (addActionListner())
- Fixed water calc bug where app was telling user to add salts when they already had the target
   value or higher.
- Fixed shallow copy of Salt out of database into (partial) deep copy
- First run at acidification (needs save/load/print and options)

Dec 27, 2007 - Jim Clark

- A few bugs with implementation of water treatment cleaned up
- A bug with notes display in xlst fixed

- Added conversion tool dialog for pressure, temp, gravity, volume and weight

Dec 19, 2007 - Jim Clark
- Properties for carb panel implemented
- Export to html for carb implemented
- Quantity.Converter and ilk now static so a nre Quanity object doesn't need to be instantiated to 
   convert a weight or volume

Dec 18, 2007 - Jim Clark
- Completed functionality of carbonation panel, still doesn't have selectable default settings in
   options dialog.

- Carbonation prime sugar list comes from malts.cvs
- Saveing and Loading carb data - NOTE does not reflect in carb tab
- Carb tab has lots of TODO left!!!!  It is currently non-functional

Dec 13, 2007 - Jim Clark
- Added fermentation schedual tab and infrastructure. Commented out of StrangeSwing 
   because it is missing save and pring functionality.
