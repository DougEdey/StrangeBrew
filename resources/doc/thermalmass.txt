I'm not a super-duper brewing wizard, but I do have some experience with 
stepping up infusions with boiling water.  (I brewed 4 beers doing it this 
way.)  I've since moved to stovetop temperature increases and an insulated 
box which I prefer.  I find using a cooler to be a little nerve-wracking.  
Missing a target temperature leads to a little too much stress for me to be 
able to relax and enjoy the brewing experience but hopefully my pain and 
suffering will be helpful for you.

>From my vague memories of high school chemistry, I recall that mass 
temperature systems can be calculated by using the following
formula (which is basically conservation of heat).

Sum of all ( Mass * Temperature ) = a constant

So for our infusion:

   Mass of mash * Initial temperature of mash
+ Mass of added water * Temperature of the added hot water
+ Mass of vessel * Initial temperature of vessel

Equals

   Mass of everything * final temp everything

The balance equation for the addition of water to the mash tun is
then:

Mi*Ti + Mt*Ti + Ma*Ta = (Mm + Mt + Ma) Tf


Where:

Ma = Mass of water to add
Mi = Mass of the mash (before addition)
Mt = Thermal mass of you vessel

Ti = Initial temperature
Tf = Desired final temperature
Ta = Temperature of added water

Solving for the amount of boiling water to add:

Mw = (Mi + Mt)*( Tf - Ti )/( Ta - Tf )

Or you could calculate the temperature of water to add by the following:

Ta = (Tf - Ti)*(Mi + Mt)/(Ma) + Tf

Now, given that, but without knowing the Mt, it'll be difficult to hit the 
temperatures you want, but you should be able to come close.  Also, unless 
you want a really thin mash for starch conversion, you have to start with a 
very thick mash for your protein rest and limit the temperature rise.  This 
actually works out OK, 'cause a thick mash works well for a protein rest.

I'm going to show my example in metric because of the convenience of 1
litre of water = 1 kg.  The formulas above are valid for any measurement 
system, but remember to work in consistent units. (lbs of water)

You can calculate the thermal mass of your vessel by experimenting
with boiling water and an empty cooler.  Typically, insulated vessels
have very low thermal mass.  A heavy steel vessel could be several
kilos.

Here's what I'll work with.  I'll estimate the thermal mass of my
cooler at 0 kg, and use 25C for initial room/grain/vessel temperature.
I'll aim for a protein rest at 50C (131F).  It's on the high end of
the scale, but it should work fine for reducing chill haze.  And if we
still be in protein conversion range.  The initial grist of 5kg will
be infused with 10 litres of water at the following strike
temperature:


Ta = ( Tf - Ti )*( Mi + Mt )/( Ma ) + Tf
Ta = ( 50C - 25C )*( 5kg + 0 )/( 10kg ) + 50C
Ta = 62.5C = Strike temp

(Also, when using a non-zero thermal mass make sure you mix in the grain 
after stabilizing your vessel's temperature.  Otherwise you may overheat 
your grain before the mash vessel has enough time to absorb some of the 
excess heat.)

This should yield a really thick (less than 1 quart per pound) 15kg of
mash at 50C, depending on the thermal mass (Mt) of your vessel and the
temperature of your your dry grain.  Let's assume we're spot on for
the sake of our example (but make sure you measure with a
thermometer and adjust the calculation for starch conversion step-up).

Before you have experience with the temperature dynamics of your
vessel, I recommend that you do one of the following: either aim for
the top end of the starch conversion range and rely on the thermal
mass not absorbing enough heat to lower you mash below starch conversion 
range, or aim for the middle and estimate the thermal mass.  In fact the 
first time through, I'm going to neglect my thermal mass *and* aim for the 
middle of starch conversion range.  I'll undoubtedly end up below my desired 
range, but it's safer to add a little more boiling water to ease it up into 
the desired range than to desperately try to lower the temp before the 
amylase gets denatured.

I'm going to aim for 66C.  So, after the protein rest I'll add the following 
amount of boiling water:

Mw = (Mi + Mt)*( Tf - Ti )/( Ta - Tf )

Mw = ( 15kg + 0 ) ( 66C - 50C ) / ( 100C - 66C )

Mw = 7.3 kg of 100C water.

 ...and if I need to raise the temperature some more I'll need about 500ml of 
boiling water per degree C.

The mash is significantly thinner at this point.  (3.46 l/kg or 1.65
qts per lb) If you are way outside your target temperature you should
quickly add more boiling or ice cold water to correct.  Missing high
is much more serious.  Especially with a thin mash, amylase will
degrade rather quickly.  Again, we aimed low, so it shouldn't be a
problem.

As an aside, I've seen at least a couple of bits of software that will
do these calculations for you.  I like filling up my brewing notebooks
with chicken scratch algebra.  I'm also more comfortable doing it by
hand because I know how and where shortcuts are being taken, and I
know what all the fields mean and what units they're in.  On the other
hand, I'm known to make the occasional error so you may want to
verify with a tool anyway.

Also be aware of the volume of your cooler.  A five gallon cooler isn't 
going to cut it, with the amount of water we'd have to add to 5kg of grain.  
You should be able to squeak by with an 8 gallon cooler.  Otherwise, you'll 
have to reduce the amount of grist.

Good luck,

Doug
