 What is this?
===============

This is a "release quality" release of StrangeBrew Java, which means 
it's feature-complete, and is pretty stable.  If you find bugs, please
report them via the Sourceforge bug tracker, or email 
bugs@strangebrew.ca.

StrangeBrew Java is a Java port of the popular Windows homebrewing
software, StrangeBrew (www.strangebrew.ca).

Donations are accepted on the SourceForge project homepage.

NOTE: We've changed the numbering of Java releases to 2.0, based on 
the idea that this is a continuation of the Windows version 1.8.


========================
Recipes at bodensatz.com
========================

There is a repository of StrangeBrew recipes available for viewing and
download at www.bodensatz.com/sb, hosted by Alan McKay.  Please feel free
to download recipes to open with StrangeBrew Java.  

==========================
 Running StrangeBrew Java
==========================

Running StrangeBrew:
1. Unzip the sb_XXX.zip file (where XXX is the latest version, eg: "sb_2.0.1").
Be sure to preserve the directory structure.
2. Type "java -jar strangebrew.jar" at the command line.  Under Windows,
you can right-click this file, select "Open With > " and select a Java
installation. You can also just double-click the file, if ".jar" files
are associated with javaw.exe.  Double-clicking reportedly also works on
Mac OSX.  There's probably a Linux way to do this, but I don't know what it is.

NOTE: StrangeBrew loads data (ingredients, styles, etc) from:
src/ca/strangebrew/data/
When you unzip the file, be sure to preserve directory names, so
that StrangeBrew can find this data.

===============================
Extra help for running on Linux
===============================

These are notes from Scott Alfter via rec.crafts.brewing:

1) Make sure CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC is enabled in the kernel (built-in or
   module)...look in Executable file formats/Emulations -> Kernel support
   for MISC binaries.
2) Add the following to /etc/fstab:
   binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc defaults 0 0
3) Create /usr/bin/jexec with the following contents and make it executable
   by everybody:
   #!/bin/sh
   java -jar $*
4) Add the following to whatever script your distro provides for local
   customization (in Gentoo, it's /etc/conf.d/local.start):
   echo ':jarexec:M::PK\x03\x04::/usr/bin/jexec:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

When you reboot (or if you execute the preceding from a root prompt), you
can chmod 755 strangeBrew_fat.jar and then run it with the following:

./strangeBrew_fat.jar

NOTE: At least one person has experienced problems running StrangeBrew on Fedora
using their 1.4.2 JRE, which is the GNU gcj.  The problem was solved by using the
1.5 JRE from Sun.  

For Ubuntu:
Install Sun's JRE:
	$ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
Update default system JVM:
	$ sudo update-alternatives --config java
  Select java-6 from the list
	$ sudo update-alternatives --config jar
  Select java-6 from the list

See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java for more help with Ubuntu.

=========================
Setting the Look and Feel
=========================

The Java Swing library (which StrangeBrew uses for its user interface) supports
a "pluggable look and feel" (LAF) -- meaning you can easily change the appearance 
of Swing applications to suit your own tastes.  

(Some betas of StrangeBrew used the JGoodies Looks LAF, but I removed
it as the default to give users more control over how the application looks).

Very nice look and feels are available on-line from several sources.  Here are 
a few of my favourites for StrangeBrew:
* JGoodies Looks: http://javootoo.l2fprod.com/plaf/jgoodies/index.php
* Liquid L&F: https://liquidlnf.dev.java.net/
* Synthetica L&F: http://www.javasoft.de/jsf/public/products/synthetica
* Tonic L&F: http://www.digitprop.com/p.php?page=toniclf

Download the .jar file you'd like to try, and put it in your Java home directory under
/lib/ext.

You can set the Look and Feel in a couple of ways:

1. From the Command-line:
Use the -Dswing.defaultlaf= option when starting the application.
Here's an example of starting StrangeBrew using the Synthetica LAF:
java -Dswing.defaultlaf=de.javasoft.plaf.synthetica.SyntheticaStandardLookAndFeel -jar strangebrew.jar

The "de.javasoft.plaf.synthetica.SyntheticaStandardLookAndFeel" bit is the full class 
name of the Look And Feel -- you'll have to read the documentation for each LAF to find 
out the proper text to put here

2. Using swing.properties:
You can set the default LAF for all Java Swing applications by editing the swing.properties
file in your $JAVA_HOME/lib directory.  You need to add two lines for your new LAF, and
change the default line.  Here's an example of the new & changed lines using the Tonic
LAF:
swing.installedlaf.tonic.name = Tonic
swing.installedlaf.tonic.class = com.digitprop.tonic.TonicLookAndFeel
swing.defaultlaf=com.digitprop.tonic.TonicLookAndFeel

Now start StrangeBrew as you would normally, and it should use the new LAF.

==========
Files 
==========

The file you downloaded should contain these files (at least):
  * strangebrew.jar: a Fat Jar file which you can run (see above).  This
    file also contains the complete Java source for the application.  To
    view the source, decompress this file with an archive utility.
  * gpl.txt: the GPL license this software is distributed under
  * readme.txt: this file
  * src/ca/strangebrew/data: data files and the xslt files required 
    for exporting HTML and printing.  You can modify the xslt files if 
    you want to customize the look of the HTML.
  * help/: help files.  These files are under development.
  * recipes/: example recipe files in various formats.    
  * src/*: all the Java files you need to build and run StrangeBrew yourself.  
    You will need to either download or extract a couple of other .jar files 
    that StrangeBrew requires.


============
Required JRE
============

You require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your system to run
StrangeBrew.  It requires versions 1.5 and up (See 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp). As of version 2.0.1, 
StrangeBrew no longer runs under version 1.4.   StrangeBrew has
been tested and runs on Linux, MacOS-X, and Windows.  

============
Known Issues
============

* When importing recipes from StrangeBrew for Windows (1.8 or earlier),
fermentables that are sugars are incorrectly considered "grains".  Their
gravity contribution is calculated using the recipe efficiency, rather than
100%.  You should uncheck the "M" (for mashed) column, which indicates that
the ingredient is a sugar.  This applies to all sugar-type fermentables, such
as honey, DME, LME, maple syrup, and sugars.

* There is no way to add or modify ingredients from within SB Java. Currently 
any custom data for hops, malts, water profiles, yeast, salts and primeing sugars
must be entered by hand into the cvs files. *WARNING* These cvs files will be 
over writen with each new install.

Reporting Bugs
==============

We're using the Sourceforge tracking feature to track bugs.  Please go to 
www.sourceforge.net/projects/strangebrew and click on "bugs" to view a list
of reported bugs.  If you've found one that's not there, please report it!

==========
What's New
==========

2.0.1
--------
New Features:
- New Gravity Teperature Tool Dialog (Request 1222300)
- New selectable user locale, which affects date format (Bug 1480514)
- New Fermentation Schedule tab
- New Carbonation tab
- New Water Treatment tab

Bugs Fixed:
- Default hop type (Leaf, Pellet, Plug) is now configurable (Request 1489276) 
- Text field auto selection (Bug 1489252)
- You can now select-by-typing in malt and hop lists (Bug 1493279)
- Mash Steps now insert at end of list (Request 1497970)
- Changed default bottle unit and size to imperal (Bug 1493267) 
- UI improvments to the saved "default" mash schedules


2.0.0
--------
Bugs Fixed:
- Mash ratio and ratio units are now properly displayed.
- After storing ingredients from an imported recipe, the database is no longer corrupted.
- Malt and hop drop-downs behave better (Bugs 1580524 and 1511954).
- Selecting a date now permanently changes it (Bug 1581203).
- The comments scrollbar now behaves correctly.
- File extensions don't keep multiplying every time you open the Save/SaveAs/Export dialogs.
- The Min column in the hops table is now handled correctly.
- The style dropdown now displays from the top of the list, rather than the bottom, for an empty style (Bug 1493269).


2.0.rc1
--------
New Features:
- StrangeBrew no longer uses the JGoodies Look And Feel by default, as this was
  causing some refresh issues on older versions of Mac OSX.  Instead, you can set
  the LAF yourself. (See the "Setting the Look And Feel" section above).
- You can now set the bottom of temp ranges used to determine mashout and sparge
  steps.  The defaults are 161F for mashout, and 170F for sparge.  This means that
  when you add a mashout step, it uses the middle of the range (161 + 170 / 2, or
  165.5F) when you add a mashout step, and if you change the start temp to <161, it
  becomes a different step type.  You can adjust these numbers to suit your mashing
  preferences.
- More and better StrangeBrew Java-specific help.  
- New Print toolbar button.

Bugs Fixed:
- FWH, mash hop, and dry hop IBU values are now correctly calculated.
- The strangebrew.ini file is now saved and read from the correct location on 
  non-Windows machines.
- HTML export now works again on non-Windows machines.  

2.0.b7
--------
New Features:
- You can now apply default mash schedules on the Mash tab to quickly load
  a popular schedule.  You can also save the current schedule to the list of
  defaults.  You can edit the /data/mashdefaults.csv file by hand to add or 
  remove a default schedule.
- The Resize Recipe dialog now allows you to also convert hops and fermentables
  (Bug 1489903).
- New potential extract calculator.  
- You can now add sparge steps to a mash schedule.  Add a step, and change the 
  type to "sparge".  If you add more than one sparge step, it's automatically
  considered a batch sparge, and correct additions are calculated.  
- You can now set the parameters for a thick and thin decoction on the 
  settings tab.
- You can now add cereal mash steps to a mash schedule.  Add a step, and change the
  method to "cereal mash".  Enter the weight of the grain used in the cereal mash.
  Other values will update accordingly.  Note: the temperature of the step is adjusted
  if the cereal mash addition brings the step above the targe temp.  Try
  decreasing the weight and adjusting the temperature until you get the values you
  want.  
- New Refractometer Utility lets you peform various calculations with readings
  from a refractometer.  

Bugs Fixed:
- You can now specify a default boil time on the Preferences Dialog (Bug 1493270)
- Style tab now displays correct SRM value when you're using EBC colour (Bug 1497989)
- You can now set various mash defaults on the Preferences dialog (Bug 1489256)
- You can now set boil units (C or F) as well as boil temp on the Preferences
  dialog (Bug 1489250)
- Cost tab now re-calculates correctly when values change (Bug 1493994)
- Final beer volume shown on cost tab now matches volume shown on water tab (Bug 1493294)
- BU:GU ratio is now displayed correctly on the Style panel (Bug 1493283).
- Dilution panel is now updated when you first open a recipe (Bug 1492475).
- Setting pre-boil amount now correctly updates post-boil amount.
- Changing mash temp units to C now correctly converts tun loss (Bug 1492220).
- Yeast now imports in BeerXML recipes. (Note: if there's more than one yeast
  listed, only the last is imported w/ the recipe).
- Find toolbar button now works (Bug 1489274).  
- Water panel numbers now aligned (Bug 1493293).
- On the preferences dialog, when you select a constant evaporation rate, the
  units are correctly displayed as the current default recipe volume units 
  (Bug 1493263).
- Removed the extra note area on the notes tab (Bug 1493286).
- Malts with a weight of 0 are correctly displayed as being 0% (Bug 1493276).  
- Malt and hop amounts are rounded to 2 decimal places instead of 1 (Bug 1493281).
- Preferences are saved in the right place on non-Windows machines.
- Misc ingredient table column widths are now nicer (Bug 1493284).
- %alc, ibu, colour method combos are wider so text isn't cut off (Bug 1489271).
- Switching between % and constant evaporation doesn't redraw the Preferences
  tab. (Bug 1493266)
- Mash tab now shows step volume and temp. (Bug 1489258)  

  
=========

====================
Building the project
====================

Complete StrangeBrew Java source is included in the strangebrew.jar file.
StrangeBrew Java source is also available via CVS via an annonymous pserver 
connection (see http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=121177 for more information).

I'm building the project in Eclipse, which is freely available at eclipse.org.  
Once you've un-archived the source from the jar file (or obtained it from cvs), you
can import it as a new project into Eclipse.  You'll need to:
- add the 3rd party .jar files in /lib (in the strangebrew.jar archive) to the 
  project libraries
- add an appropriate Sun JRE (1.5+) to the project libraries, if one is not already
  selected

That should be all you need to build and run the program.

If you wish to build the application from Ant, Greg LaPolla has kindly contributed
a build file (build.xml in the top level of the source tree).
